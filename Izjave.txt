Cowabunga!
BOOYAKASHA!

Are you guys thinking what I’m thinking?

Bodacious!

Gentlemen, and Raphael

Hellacious!

I always thought the future of ninjutsu would be taller.

I can’t keep fighting alien technology with a six foot staff.

Looks more like fall to me.

The bonds of family are stronger than steel…

The Rat is the cleanest one.

We’re dealing with a real mind here.

What kind of idiot puts his name on a death machine?

What language is that Mikey? Nitwit?

You don’t understand science.

You live, you die, you fight as brothers!
